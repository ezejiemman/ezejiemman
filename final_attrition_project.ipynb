    "\n",
    "Aileadtech wants to bring down the cost of retaining employees by limiting incentives to only employees who are at risk of Attrition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study aims to use employee characteristics to predict if an employee is at risk of attrition. The data for this study was provided by Aileadtech.The data which is in csv format was loaded into the Jupyter notebook using pandas. The data contains 34 features of each employee and the Attrition target.There are 2940 observations.Importantly the target is unbalanced. From the target, the objective of the study can be achieved using a classification supervision learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was first subjected to cleaning techniques such as removal of irrevalant values and duplicates, conversion of data types, check and handling of missing values, and was further explored to gain a deeper understanding of it. The summary characteristics, correlation, features data type backed with relevant visualization are some of the exploratory work done on the data. Also some features were dropped based on their correlation coefficients with similar features. Others were dropped because they have same value for all entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaned data went through a preprocessing stage such as data conversion and normalization. The end product is a numerical format that is required by Sklearn algorithms for predictive modeling. Two separate functions were created which returned the variables for modeling, for both the balanced and unbalanced data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search algorithm which employs cross validation technique was used to evaluate the performance of three supervised classification algorithms(LogisticRegression, DecisionTRee, RandomForest). This exercise was carried out on both the balanced and unbalanced data for the sake of comparing the performace of both data. The unbalanced data performed better for the three algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the modeling stage, the data was divided into train and test dataset.The variables from both the balanced and unbalanced data were use to create different models and their performance accuracies with the test data obtained. A function was created to handle modeling and performance accuracies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The balanced data performed better with the three algorithms considered at this stage.\n",
    "Two tables comparing the performace of the three algorithms on both the balanced and unbalanced data were created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of overfits is drastically reduced but not totally eliminated using the balanced data. Also the recall score also improved with the balanced data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "Based on the results obtained by applying the three algorithms on the balanced data, DecisionTreeClassifier model performed best and can be deployed by the company to fulfill her goal.\n",
